## About the finder
This site began as a single jQuery-powered button hitting the [Sunlight Congress API][sunlight] and has grown to include the Google Maps Javascript API and lots of vanilla JS. The map's data layer was built using data from the [U.S. Census Bureau][census], converted to GeoJSON with [Mapshaper][mapshaper], and populated with representative data using the Congress API once again.
If you have feature suggestions or bug reports, please raise an issue on this repository.
